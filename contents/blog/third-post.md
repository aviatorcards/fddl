# Minimalism in User Interface Design

Minimalism is not about the absence of elements; it is about the presence of only the essential. In an era of information overload, a minimal interface is a mercy to the user.

## The Pillars of Minimal UI

1.  **Hierarchy**: Use scale and weight to tell the user what matters most.
2.  **Space**: Negative space (white space) gives the content room to breathe.
3.  **Color**: Use color sparingly for emphasis, not just decoration.

## Application in fddl

The default template of `fddl` follows these principles. It strips away sidebars, pop-ups, and trackers to focus on the one thing that matters: **The Words.**

### Comparison Table

| Feature | Bloated Web | Minimal Web |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Load Time** | 5s - 10s | <500ms |
| **Cognitive Load** | High | Low |
| **SEO** | Struggling | Excellent |

By choosing a static site generator, you are already halfway to a minimal, high-impact design.
