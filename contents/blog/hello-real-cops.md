# Real Journaling? Online? In 2026?!

I've been toying with the idea of putting my real journal entries, or at least an edited version, online. Noticing that [Tahoe](https://www.apple.com/os/macos/) comes with [Journal](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/journal/id6447391597), I'm starting to think it's possible for me to do this.

Many, many years ago - say, around 2000 - I was in a band and we played with another band whose guitarist I got alone with for the duration of the show. He was also a pretty big nerd, but he had, ya know, ambition. This was before cell phones were common for anyone, let alone a teenager. (400 minutes, nights and weekends!)
