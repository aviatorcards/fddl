# About Me

Hello, I'm a developer, designer, and curious tinkerer. I spend most of my time building tools that make people's lives easier and digital experiences more delightful.

## My Philosophy

I believe that software should be **fast**, **private**, and **beautiful**. 

- **Fast**: If it's not instant, it's breaking the flow.
- **Private**: Your data belongs to you. Period.
- **Beautiful**: High utility shouldn't come at the cost of high aesthetics.

## What I'm Working On

Currently, I'm obsessed with **Static Site Generators** (hence, `fddl`) and how they can be made more accessible to developers who want to control every pixel without the overhead of heavy frameworks like Next.js.

## Tools of the Trade

```swift
let tools = [
    "Swift", "Rust", "Go",
    "TailwindCSS", "PostgreSQL",
    "Antigravity AI"
]

print("Crafting with: \(tools.joined(separator: ", "))")
```

## Get in Touch

I'm always open to collaboration on interesting projects. If you're building something that pushes the boundaries of what's possible, I'd love to hear about it.
