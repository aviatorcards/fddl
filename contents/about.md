# About Me

Hey, I'm Tristan. I don't call myself anything because I don't like that. I spend my time trying to actively avoid interacting with capitalism in any way possible. My brain is pretty broken in the way that I vew the world comparitively to most people. I think people are deserving of food, shelter, housing, and access to healthcare. I can objectively see that capitalism is incompatible with any kind of prolonged existence for living beings. Infinite growth predicated on finite resources in a living organism is called cancer. This isn't me being edgy. This is an observation.

## My Philosophy

I believe that software should be **free** and **open source**. However, not all open source licenses are created equal. I believe that the GPL is the best license for software that is intended to be used by the public. It is the most permissive license that still ensures that the software remains free and open source. Licenses like the MIT, BSD, and Apache licenses are not good for software that is intended to be used by the public. They allow for the software to be used inside a closed system, which is a violation of the principles of free software. The coreutils of the GNU project are a prime example of this. Being rewritten in Rust is a step in the right direction, but the uutools project is licensed with the MIT license, allowing it to be taken, baked into proprietary software, and used for profit.

## What I'm Working On

In 2025, I installed macOS on my ThinkPad T480s and started learning Swift. I was immediately drawn to the language and its potential as someone who's struggled learning languages in the past. Swift has been the only language that I've found that I genuinely enjoy learning. My primary project right now is **fddl**, the static site generator powering this site, alongside **Atmosphere**, a journaling app built to explore SwiftUI, and **Rookery**, a place to store your code snippets on the web. Everything else feels like a chore, becomes unfun, and I stop learning. If I get bored, I stop caring about whatever it is that I'm doing in life.

<!-- ## Tools I've been trying to learn

```swift
let tools = [
    "Swift", "Go",
    "TailwindCSS"
]

print("Crafting with: \(tools.joined(separator: ", "))")
``` -->

## Get in Touch

I'm mostly antisocial at this point. I don't like doing things or interacting with people.
