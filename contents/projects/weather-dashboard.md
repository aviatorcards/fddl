# Atmosphere

Atmosphere is more than just a weather forecast; it's a data engine for climate awareness.

## Data Visualization

### Visual Styles
- **Glassmorphism**: A sleek, modern UI that adapts to current weather conditions.
- **Dynamic Palettes**: The site's color scheme shifts based on temperature and air quality.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Vite + React
- **Graphics**: D3.js & Three.js
- **API**: DarkSky & OpenWeatherMap
