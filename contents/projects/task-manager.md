# Orbit

Orbit is a distraction-free task manager built for people who value focus. Unlike cloud-first tools, Orbit stores everything locally.

## Design Goals

1.  **Zero Latency**: Interactions must feel tactile and immediate.
2.  **Encryption**: All data is encrypted with keys that only the user holds.
3.  **Cross-Platform**: Seamless sync across Mac, iPhone, and iPad.

## Technical Implementation

Orbit is built entirely with SwiftUI and uses **Core Data + CloudKit** for robust, multi-device synchronization. It features a custom natural language processor for quick task entry.
