# Roman Carbonara

No cream. Just eggs, cheese, pork, and pepper. It's an algorithm for deliciousness.

## Ingredients

- 400g Spaghetti
- 150g Guanciale (or Pancetta)
- 4 Large egg yolks
- 1 Large whole egg
- 100g Pecorino Romano (freshly grated)
- Black pepper (lots of it)

## Instructions

1.  **Pasta**: Boil well-salted water. Cook spaghetti until *al dente*.
2.  **Pork**: While pasta cooks, fry guanciale in a large pan until the fat renders and it's crispy. Remove from heat.
3.  **The Emulsion**: In a bowl, whisk eggs and cheese together into a thick paste.
4.  **Assemble**: Toss hot pasta into the pan with the pork fat. 
5.  **The Trick**: Remove pan from heat. Quickly pour in the egg mixture and a splash of pasta water. Toss vigorously until a creamy sauce forms.

*Warning: If the pan is too hot, you'll get scrambled eggs. Timing is everything!*
